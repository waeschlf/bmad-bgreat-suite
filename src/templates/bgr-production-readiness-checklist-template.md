## 3. Overall Readiness Assessment

### 3.1 Readiness Gate

| Criterion | Met? | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| All 8 workflow plans completed | | |
| Cross-plan references are consistent | | |
| No critical gaps identified | | |
| Key decisions align across plans | | |

### 3.2 Readiness Status

**Overall Status**: NOT READY

> Update this status to READY when all eight workflow plans are complete, cross-references are consistent, and no critical gaps remain.

## 4. Gap Analysis

### 4.1 Cross-Plan Dependency Gaps

> Identified when a workflow references a decision or artifact from another plan that is missing, inconsistent, or contradictory.

| Gap | Source Plan | Depends On | Severity | Resolution |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|------------|

### 4.2 Coverage Gaps

> Areas where no workflow plan addresses a production readiness concern.

| Gap | Expected Coverage | Recommendation |
|-----|------------------|----------------|

### 4.3 Consistency Issues

> Decisions made in one plan that conflict with decisions in another.

| Issue | Plan A Decision | Plan B Decision | Resolution |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|------------|

## 5. Recommended Completion Order

The following order maximizes context sharing between workflows:

1. **Observability Plan** -- Establishes metrics strategy, SLOs, and alerting that inform all other plans
2. **Incident Response Plan** -- Builds on Observability alerting to define severity, escalation, and runbooks
3. **Infrastructure Plan** -- References Observability for monitoring targets and Incident Response for operational procedures
4. **CI/CD Pipeline Plan** -- References Infrastructure for deployment targets and Observability for verification gates
5. **Security Plan** -- Defines auth strategy, compliance requirements, and security controls that constrain all other plans
6. **Disaster Recovery Plan** -- Defines RTO/RPO targets and failover procedures that inform Infrastructure multi-region design
7. **Capacity Planning** -- Defines growth models and scaling triggers that reference Observability metrics and Infrastructure auto-scaling
8. **Cost Optimization Plan** -- References Capacity Planning for growth projections, Infrastructure for resource topology, and Observability for SLO-cost trade-offs

## 6. Live Operations Log

> Incidents triaged with `bgr-4-incident-triage`. Planning gaps found during incidents feed back into section 4.

| Incident | Severity | Service | Status | Record | Postmortem |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|--------|------------|
